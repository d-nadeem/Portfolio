								<p> Hey, My name is Danish Nadeem pronounced /Dan ish/ /Na deem/. I was born and raised in Canada 
                                    all my life. Ever since I was little I had a great intrest in making stuff, so when it came time 
                                    to go to University I decided to go to Ontario Tech University because they offered a Mechatronics 
                                    Program and had a great Co-op program to allow me to network with other industries to have access to 
                                    great opportunities. I am hoping that YOU will have an intrest in working together in the near future. ;)
                                    <p>

										<p> When it came time to choose a program for my post secondary I wanted to be in a program that is versitile and does not 
											pose limits to what I want to learn. I came to learn about mechatronics engineering a few years prior, and fell in love 
											with it as it a combination of mechanical, electronic, and software engineering. I was also happy to learn that 
											the program is offered by a univeristy close enough that I would not need residence, hence is the reason why am 
											I enrolled in the MECHATRONICS ENGINEERING program, at Ontario Tech Univeristy.

												<p> I am studying mechatronics engineering which is a field in engineering where the combination of 
													mechanical, electronic, and computer science is used. The program give me experience from each of those fields
													which I can use in many applications, such as robotics, mechanical and electronic systems.
